:Version: Draft
:Authors: universal-ctags developers
:Web Page: https://ctags.io/

Introduction
======================================================================
universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the
development from what existed in the Sourceforge area. Github
exuberant-ctags repository was started by Reza Jelveh
<reza.jelveh@gmail.com> and was later moved to the universal-ctags
organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified
space where people interested in making ctags better can work
together.

This guide is for developers. ctags.1 man page is for users.
Though ctags.1 is not updated yet because universal-ctags is still in
development.

Proofreading and pull-requests are welcome!

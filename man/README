Rules for writing man pages
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* put two single quotes around an option name like ``--help``.

* put double quotes an exapmle of command line or option usage like
  "--langdef=MyLang".

* .. code-block:: LANGUAGE.. cannot be handled well in rst2man.
  However, if LANGUAGE is not given, it works.

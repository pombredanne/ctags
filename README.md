universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the development from
what existed in the Sourceforge area. Github exuberant-ctags
repository was started by Reza Jelveh and was later moved to the
universal-ctags organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified working
space where people interested in making ctags better can work
together.

Pull-requests are welcome!
